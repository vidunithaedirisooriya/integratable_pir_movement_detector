integratable_pir_movement_detector

a pir sensor based simple DIY low cost security device that uses an existing security system to notify movements. This project is centered around the affordable and well documented arduino nano. The widely available PIR sensor module senses movements and a 5v active buzzer and the builtin led act when a movement is detected. To find the MESSAGE_CORRESPONDING_TO_YOUR_SECURITY_SYSTEM and the CORRESPONDING_LENGTH, connect the receiver of the 433MHz transmitter to the arduino according to this example https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch/blob/master/examples/ReceiveDemo_Simple/ReceiveDemo_Simple.ino  and observe the value and bitlength of an existing component of the security system. You may experiment this on your own devices at your own risk. (CORRESPONDING_LENGTH = getReceivedBitlength(). MESSAGE_CORRESPONDING_TO_YOUR_SECURITY_SYSTEM = getReceivedValue() if you want this to show up as that component. )
